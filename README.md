# 1000xDevoloperSchedule
In order to improve your programming skills and strive to achieve world-class expertise, it is essential to follow a well-structured schedule. I have personally devised a schedule that has proven to be effective, and I highly recommend that you consider adopting it as well.

| Time | Activity | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7:00 - 7:30 AM | Morning Routine: Wake up, freshen up, and have breakfast. | Starting the day with a routine can set the tone for productivity and focus. |
| 7:30 - 9:30 AM | Feature Development: Develop new features for the project. | The brain is at its peak performance 2-4 hours after waking up, making it the best time for complex tasks like feature development. |
| 9:30 - 11:30 AM | Kaizen Blitz: Pay down technical debt, refactor code, and improve system design. | Mid-morning is a good time for this as you're still in a focused state but not as fresh as the first thing in the morning. |
| 11:30 - 12:30 PM | Code Review: Review code written by other developers. | This can be a good time to switch to a different type of task, keeping the mind engaged and preventing fatigue. |
| 12:30 - 1:30 PM | Lunch & Learning Time: Have a meal while learning new technologies, reading articles, or watching tutorials. | Combining lunch with learning can make efficient use of time. |
| 1:30 - 3:30 PM | Testing: Write and run tests for the code written in the morning. | Early afternoon can often be a productive time, and it's good to take advantage of this before the mid-afternoon energy dip. |
| 3:30 - 5:30 PM | Collaboration Time: Work with other developers, discuss ideas, and solve problems together. | Collaboration can be more effective when people have had a chance to get through their individual tasks and can bring their full attention to the team. |
| 5:30 - 6:30 PM | Dinner & Learning Time: Have a meal while learning new technologies, reading articles, or watching tutorials. | Similar to lunch, this is an efficient use of time. |
| 6:30 - 8:30 PM | Debugging: Debug any issues found during testing. | This can be a productive time for many people, especially for those who are night owls. |
| 8:30 - 10:30 PM | Kaizen Blitz: Continue to pay down technical debt, refactor code, and improve system design. | Late evening can be a good time for this kind of work, as it doesn't require as much intense concentration as deep work. |
| 10:30 - 11:30 PM | GitHub Issues: Review and resolve any remaining issues reported on GitHub. | Wrapping up the day with lighter tasks like this can help wind down before bed. |
| 11:30 - 1:00 AM | Plan: Review the day's work, document progress, plan for the next day. | It's important to have time to reflect on the day and recall what you have done and how this relates to your mission.|
